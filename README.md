# Blockchain_Final

Final project for Blockchain Development and Security at PSU, Fall 2020. Transferred from Gitlab. 

Goal was to create a simple smart contract/webapp using Metamask and vyper wherein someone could make a list of tasks with ETH bounties, and others could complete them. 
Then, the creator of the task list can verify and cash out the individual tasks, initiating the ETH transfer, or reject them, resetting the task.  

Tested application with the idea of chore-related tasks, but would likely be more appropriate for something like bug bounties/bug squashing events. 
Contracts should not stay up for long periods of time. 

Credit to Wu-chang Feng for some boilerplate code from his Guestbook application, which was then worked off of for this project.
